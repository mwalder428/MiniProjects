This folder contains a Jupyter notebook I wrote at the beginning of my PhD to study orbit integration techniques and the properties of orbits in different gravitational potentials.  I create a class (OrbitIntegrator) which contains all functions needed including calculating the acceleration on a particle in orbit due to a chosen gravitational potential (either Keplarian or Galactic), the integration technique used (either Kick-Drift-Kick or Drift-Kick-Drift), and the actual integration process.  

Additionally, I include functions which create and integrate the orbits of multiple particles bound to a chosen gravitational potential to simulate what happens to a cluster of stars in orbit around a galaxy.

I have mainly trimmed the notebook down to a few cells showing an example of one particle in orbit with a constant timestep, and then launching a specified number of particles with similar initial properties in orbit and integrating them with varying timesteps.  In this folder, I have attached 2 videos (movie_galaxy.mp4 and movie_kepler.mp4) each showing the plots of the particle positions produced at the bottom of the notebook over time in a Keplarian vs a galaxy gravitational potential.
